DEBIAN PRESEED PROCESS:

Place the preseed file, the script file, and the iso file you downloaded together into a directory of your choice.

Use a Debian Linux interpreter to run the script.sh file (i.e. run ./script.sh from the directory)

The script file will extract the iso image, edit it, then repack it into a new iso image with the preseed embedded. The new iso image may then be used to install debian.
