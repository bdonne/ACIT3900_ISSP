1) We are using Ubuntu 19.0 and after to config this kiosk system, please install the lastest Ubuntu from: https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop/thank-you?country=CA&version=19.10&architecture=amd64
  This also works on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS

2) Install the system and make sure you have access to the internet

3) Copy "Kiosk_Config" folder and all its files to your home directory

4) Run 'kiosk_setup_1.sh' as root to preconfig the system

5) Now we should have an account called 'Student'; login as Student

6) Chromium - Setup Homepage:
   * Launch Chromium browser
   * Settings -> find the 'On Start-up' section
   * Choose 'Open a specific page or set of pages'
   * Choose 'Add a new page'
   * Input 'learn.bcit.ca'

7) Chromium - Disable auto-fill
   * Launch Chromium browser
   * Settings -> find the 'Auto-fill' section

   * Ubuntu -> devices -> keyboard shortcuts(you can directly search 'keyboard')
   * [Important] disable all shortcuts EXCEPT "Close Window" option with default hotkey "Alt + F4" as this is the only way you logout        from the kiosk system, in the kiosk system, close the browser window will automatically logout from the system.
