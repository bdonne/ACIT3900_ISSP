Restricted Boot Resource
Authors: Brian Donnally, JiaJun Cai, Zachary Johnston, Pavan Josan, Abdullah Abdullah, Ellery Lee

This Repo contains different resources for generating a USB Boot for BCIT Students to take online exams on their personal computers where access to local resources is completely restricted. The Kiosk Config sets up a Kiosk on a user account on an Ubuntu image, which can then be placed on a USB. This requires the PC to have a USB boot option enabled in BIOS/UEFI.

The LTSP contains information and scripts to create a Linux Terminal Server from an Ubuntu 18.04 or later image. This image can then serve the Kiosk user account over Ethernet as a netboot option.
